# DISCLAIMER
I am a big NixOS noob so this config is probably terrible. Don't judge me I'm trying my hardest.

## Important step
Make sure to run `git update-index --assume-unchanged eww/dashboard/scripts/mails.py` and `git update-index --assume-unchanged eww/dashboard/scripts/weather_info` to avoid leaking api keys and login credentials.
